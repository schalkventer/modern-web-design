# The Hidden 90%

**I recently started doing some Interaction Design curriculum development for the** [**Creative Academy**](https://creativeacademy.ac.za)**, a tertiary-level design school based in** [**Cape Town, South Africa**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town)**.**

It's been a couple of years since I started my own journey into the world of web-design, and in the context of the former, I thought about retracing some of steps that lead me to where I find myself today. This included, amongst others, rummaging through several bookcases in search of a dusty [Don't Make Me Think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515) by [Steve Krug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Krug) and the more recent [Atomic Design](https://shop.bradfrost.com) by [Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/). I also went back into history, re-reading some seminal [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) and [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/) articles.

Given that it's been almost a decade now, I was \(perhaps reasonably\) anticipating that most of the material would age quite poorly. To the contrary, I was actually suprised by the degree to which some of them still hold up.  One thing I didn't anticipate though is just for how my own experiences over the last couple of years would shape how differently I would read them. Some sections and paragraphs that I quickly glossed over initially ended up being treasure troves of insight this time around. The most prominent was perhaps the introductory paragraph to [Style Tiles and How They Work](https://alistapart.com/article/style-tiles-and-how-they-work) by [Samantha Warren](http://samanthatoy.com/) \(current director of design at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/)\):

> _When you engage in a new client project how do you get started? A solid process plays a critical role in the project’s overall success, yet this process is one of the deepest darkest secrets of our industry_.

Not only has my time in the industry shaped my appreciation for how easy it is for a design process to go off the rails, but also how much of a process going astray is primarily due to the designer \(or design team\) not sufficiently stepping into to role of facilitation and expectation management.

### The Hidden Interface

**Almost a decade ago I had a naive expectation that a designer's job would be purely technical in nature.** 

Over time I've come to realise that modern-day web designers are not only designing external-facing deliverables, but also internal-facing artifacts intended to help the client \(or team\) navigate the design process itself. Surely, but slowly, I became aware of how anaemic this aspect of the process tends to be in the industry at large. From what I've been able to piece together this seems to come down to a misconception of most designers as solitary, creative geniuses that disappear into their respectively little cubicles and re-emerge with creative brilliance.

Obviously I've over-dramatised the above for comedic effect, in practice the above tends plays out more subtly. To quote [Adam Connor](http://adamconnor.com/) and [Aaron Irizarry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaroni/) from their seminal [Discussing Design](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/discussing-design/9781491902394/) \(2015\): 

> _What individuals and organizations that fall into this trap fail to realize is that when a project is tasked with making something, no matter what it is, every single team member is a part of the design process. Design doesn’t just happen in the design department. It happens with every decision about what will or won’t be part of the final product, whether that’s a feature, a paragraph of content, a color pallet, a user interface pattern — anything._

> _\[...\]_

> Collaboration and coordination are critical elements in the success of projects in most \(if not all\) modern organizations. There isn’t a single individual who is responsible for coming up with an idea, designing it, building it, selling it, and supporting it. Instead, these responsibilities and the expertise that come with them are divided among a variety of contributors who each bring knowledge to the team. So, we need to work together, combining our skills and know-how. And to work together, we need to talk with one another. We need to discuss what it is we’re designing, why we’re creating it, and how it will all come together.

### Enter Human-Centered Design

Over time, much to my delight, I started seen the field of user experience and product design really start picking up on this notion. [User personas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_%28user_experience%29) and [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) started becoming the rule rather than the exception across the industry. In retrospect, it almost seems unreal how quickly these practices were adopted into the work we were doing at [OpenUp](https://openup.org.za/) for [South Africa's National Department of Treasury](https://openup.org.za/projects/vulekamali), a government department known for its adheres to annual waterfall cycles.

**Truly the language of user-centred design has become mainstream.**

While these were super-helpful tools in interrogating the ontological side of things \(meaning what exactly we were building, what will be included and how it will be structured\), I couldn't help but feel that there was still something missing: a deliberate and calculated way in which to iterate over the look and feel of the content and structure. More often than not conversations about stylistic decisions were preceded by designer retreating behind some magic creative curtain, re-emerging with beatifully crafted interface elements.

It felt like the client was dragged from the meticulious world of content and structure to the world of look and feel in one big leap of faith.
