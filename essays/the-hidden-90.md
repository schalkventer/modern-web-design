# The Hidden 90%

**I recently started doing some Interaction Design curriculum development for the** [**Creative Academy**](https://creativeacademy.ac.za)**, a tertiary-level design school based in** [**Cape Town, South Africa**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town)**.**

It's been a couple of years since I started my own journey into the world of web-design, and in the context of the former, I thought about retracing some of the steps that lead to where I find myself today. This included, amongst others, rummaging through several bookcases in search of a dusty [Don't Make Me Think](https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Think-Revisited-Usability/dp/0321965515) by [Steve Krug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Krug) and the more recent [Atomic Design](https://shop.bradfrost.com) by [Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com/). I also went back into the history of seminal [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) and [A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/) articles.

Granted, it's been almost a decade now. I was anticipating that some of the material would have aged quite poorly. I actually ended up being suprised by how well some of them hold still hold up.  However, I did not prepare myself just for how much my own experiences over the last couple of years would shape how differently I would read some of these. Some sections and paragraphs that I quickly glossed over initially ended up being treasure troves of insight. The most prominent was perhaps the introductory paragraph to [Style Tiles and How They Work](https://alistapart.com/article/style-tiles-and-how-they-work) by [Samantha Warren](http://samanthatoy.com/) \(current director of design at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com/)\):

> _When you engage in a new client project how do you get started? A solid process plays a critical role in the project’s overall success, yet this process is one of the deepest darkest secrets of our industry_.

Not only has my time in the industry shaped my appreciation for how easy it is for a design process to go astray, but also how much of a process going off the rails is due to the designer not sufficiently stepping up to the property team facilitation and expectation management.

### Another Type of Interface

**Almost a decade ago I had a naive expectation that a designer's job would be purely technical in nature.** 

Over the years I've come to realise that modern-day developers are not only designing external-facing artifacts, but also internal-facing artifacts intended to help the client \(or team\) navigate and make sense of the design process itself. I started becoming aware of how anaemic this part of the process tends to be in the industry at large. From what I've been able to piece together this seems to come down to a misconception of designers as solitary, creative geniuses that disappear into their respectively little cubicles and re-emerge with a fully polished masterwork - somehow bringing into being something from the nothingness of a blank screen.

Obviously I've over-dramatised the above a bit for comedic effect, however, in practice the above plays out a bit more subtly. To quote [Adam Connor](http://adamconnor.com/) and [Aaron Irizarry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaroni/) from their seminal [Discussing Design](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/discussing-design/9781491902394/) \(2015\): 

> _What individuals and organizations that fall into this trap fail to realize is that when a project is tasked with making something, no matter what it is, every single team member is a part of the design process. Design doesn’t just happen in the design department. It happens with every decision about what will or won’t be part of the final product, whether that’s a feature, a paragraph of content, a color pallet, a user interface pattern — anything._

> _\[...\]_

> Collaboration and coordination are critical elements in the success of projects in most \(if not all\) modern organizations. There isn’t a single individual who is responsible for coming up with an idea, designing it, building it, selling it, and supporting it. Instead, these responsibilities and the expertise that come with them are divided among a variety of contributors who each bring knowledge to the team. So, we need to work together, combining our skills and know-how. And to work together, we need to talk with one another. We need to discuss what it is we’re designing, why we’re creating it, and how it will all come together.

Over time, much to my delight, I started seen the field of user experience and product design really start picking up on this notion. [User personas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_%28user_experience%29) and [user stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story) started becoming the rule rather than the exception across the industry. In retrospect, it almost seems unreal how quickly these practices were adopted into the work we were doing at [OpenUp](https://openup.org.za/) for [South Africa's National Department of Treasury](https://openup.org.za/projects/vulekamali), a government department known for its adheres to annual waterfall cycles.

**Truly the language of user-centred design has become mainstream.**

While these were super-helpful tools in interrogating the ontological side of things \(meaning what exactly we were building, what will be included and how it will be structured\), I couldn't help but feel that there was still something missing: a deliberate and calculated way in which to iterate over the look and feel of the content and structure. More often than not conversations about stylistic decisions were preceded by designer retreating behind some magic creative curtain, re-emerging with beatifully crafted interface elements.

It felt like the client was dragged from the meticulious world of content and structure to the world of look and feel in one big leap of faith.
